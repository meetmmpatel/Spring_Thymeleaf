Thymeleaf is a Java XML/XHTML/HTML5 Template Engine that can work both in web (Servlet-based) and non-web environments. It is better suited for serving XHTML/HTML5 at the view layer of MVC-based web applications, 
but it can process any XML file even in offline environments. It provides full Spring Framework integration.
